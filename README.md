3. Log in using your Miniflux username and password or API key (recommended)

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages

ReactFlux is built with React and generates a set of static web files after building, which can be directly deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

You can deploy it on Cloudflare Pages by selecting `Framework preset` as `Create React App`.

### Using Pre-built Files

You can download the pre-built files from the `gh-pages` branch and deploy them to any static hosting service that supports single-page applications (SPA).

Make sure to configure URL rewriting to redirect all requests to `index.html`.

If you are deploying using Nginx, you might need to add the following configuration:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```
